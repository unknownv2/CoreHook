[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/CoreHook.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=f97356)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoreHook)

A library that simplifies intercepting application function calls using managed code and the .NET Core runtime. 
Inspired and based on the great [EasyHook](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook). 

:sparkles: This is a fork from the original [CoreHook](https://github.com/unknownv2/CoreHook) by @unknownv2, adding .NET 5+ compatibility and widly refactoring the sources (I hope the original author won't be upset about it :wink:).

:information_source: _This project name will probably change in a near future, since .NET isn't named Core anymore._

## Features

* Intercept public API functions such as `CreateFile`
* Intercept internal functions by address or [name if symbol files are available](#windows-symbol-support)
* Supports NuGet package references for the plugin libraries 
* Supports multiple architectures for the plugins

For more information, [see the wiki](https://github.com/unknownv2/CoreHook/wiki).

## Differences with the original CoreHook project

* Now supports .NET 5+.
* Major refactoring to simplify the code (too many interfaces and split classes for me!)
* CoreHook.Loader is now embedded into the main CoreHook project (I guess there was a good reason for not doing it, but I have yet to check that...)
* Updated the C++ .NET host to support .NET 5+ and moved it into the same solution (now named CoreHook.NativeHost)
* Simplified the examples while keeping the same functionality

Note: the CoreHook.IPC project should be moved outside the CoreHook repository and probably renamed as it is not solely usable in this context but for any inter-process communication needs.

## Supported Platforms

CoreHook supports application function call interception on various architectures running [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x). [Linux and macOS support is also planned](https://github.com/unknownv2/CoreHook/wiki/Linux-and-macOS-Support).

## Usage

### Windows

If you are building the CoreHook project (for example, with `dotnet build`) and not publishing it, you must setup the project configuration as described below.

#### Project Configuration

The project provides two options for configuring the runtime: 

1. A local configuration file named `CoreHook.runtimeconfig.json` (which is located next to `CoreHook.dll` assembly in the CoreHook output directory) to initialize CoreCLR. 
2. A global configuration file named `dotnet.runtimeconfig.json`.

The host module will first attempt to use the local configuration file, then it will check for the global configuration file and use that if it exists, and finally it will use the directory of the `CoreHook.dll` assembly for resolving dependencies.

The `runtimeconfig` file must contain the framework information for hosting .NET Core in the target application.
When you build any .NET 5+ application, these files are generated to the output directory. [For more information on the configuration options, see here](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/master/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md).

You can use the `CoreHook.FileMonitor.runtimeconfig.json` and `CoreHook.FileMonitor.runtimeconfig.dev.json` files found in your build output directory as references for creating the global or local configuration files.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

:warning: The following has to be reviewed and hasn't been updated for this fork.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The runtime configuration file should look like the one below, where `additionalProbingPaths` contains file paths the host module can check for additional dependencies. This guide assumes you have installed the `.NET Core 2.2` runtime or SDK for both x86 and x64 architectures.

**Notice: Either replace `<user>` with your local computer user name or modify the paths to point to where your NuGet packages are installed. Take a look at `CoreHook.FileMonitor.runtimeconfig.dev.json` in the output directory to find your paths.**

```json
{
  "runtimeOptions": {
    "tfm": "netcoreapp2.2",
    "framework": {
      "name": "Microsoft.NETCore.App",
      "version": "2.2.0"
    },
    "additionalProbingPaths": [
      "C:\\Users\\<user>\\.dotnet\\store\\|arch|\\|tfm|",
      "C:\\Users\\<user>\\.nuget\\packages",
      "C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\NuGetFallbackFolder"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Local Configuration

To use a local configuration, create a file with the contents described above called `CoreHook.runtimeconfig.json` and save it to the project output directory where `CoreHook.dll` is located.

#### Global Configuration

To use a global configuration, first create a `dotnet.runtimeconfig.json` file with the contents described above and save it to a folder. This will be the global configuration file the project uses to initialize the runtime in the target processs. In this example, our file is saved at `C:\CoreHook\dotnet.runtimeconfig.json`.

Set the environment variables for the `x86` and `x64` applications to the directory of the runtime configuration file. This allows you to have different configuration files for `32-bit` and `64-bit` applications. 

For example (if you saved the file another installation directory or drive, make sure to use that path instead):

 * Set `CORE_ROOT_32` to `C:\CoreHook` for `32-bit` applications.
 
 * Set `CORE_ROOT_64` to `C:\CoreHook` for `64-bit` applications.


```ps
setx CORE_ROOT_64 "C:\CoreHook"
setx CORE_ROOT_32 "C:\CoreHook"
```

Or set them for the current command prompt session with:

```
set CORE_ROOT_64=C:\CoreHook
set CORE_ROOT_32=C:\CoreHook
```

Then, you can either open the `CoreHook` solution in `Visual Studio` or run `dotnet build` to build the library and the examples.

#### Installing Dependencies

Dependencies are already embedded in this project as they shouldn't be updated that regularly. They are saved in the Native folder of the CoreHook project.

### Windows 10 UWP

You can get the Application User Model Id (AUMID) required for launching UWP apps for the FileMonitor example with [this script:](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/find-the-application-user-model-id-of-an-installed-app)
```ps
$installedapps = get-AppxPackage

$aumidList = @()
foreach ($app in $installedapps)
{
    foreach ($id in (Get-AppxPackageManifest $app).package.applications.application.id)
    {
        $aumidList += $app.packagefamilyname + "!" + $id
    }
}

$aumidList
```
 You can print the list using the `$aumidList` variable.

 **Notes:** There is currently no way to set the proper access control on our pipes on the .NET Core platform and the issue is [being tracked here](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/31190) so we use P/Invoke to call `kernel32.dll!CreateNamedPipe` directly.

### Windows 10 IoT Core (ARM)

**[Raspberry Pi itself is supported only as deployment target but there is an unsupported version of the SDK available as well. Read more about the publishing process by following this link.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/samples/RaspberryPiInstructions.md)**

For `Windows 10 IoT Core`, you can publish the application by running the `publish.ps1` [PowerShell script](#publishing-script).

```ps
.\publish -example win32 -runtime win-arm
```

Make sure to also copy the `coreload32.dll` and the `corehook32.dll` to the directory of the program. For example, the application directory structure should look like this:

```
[+]Publish\win32\win-arm\
    [+]Hook\
        ...
        [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.Hook.deps.json
        [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.Hook.dll
        ...
    ...    
    [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.dll
    [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.exe
    [-] corehook32.dll
    [-] coreload32.dll
    ...
```


You can then copy the folder to your device and start the `CoreHook.FileMonitor.exe` program.

### Publishing Script

The PowerShell script `publish.ps1` allows you to publish the [examples](/examples) as self-contained executables. The default configuration is `Release` and the output will be in the `Publish` directory, created in the same location as the publishing script.

```ps
.\publish -example [uwp|win32] -runtime [Runtime IDentifier] -configuration [Debug|Release]
```

**You can find a list of Runtime IDentifiers [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)**.

For example, the command

```ps
.\publish -example win32 -runtime win10-arm
```

will create a folder called `Publish/win32/win10-arm/` containing the `CoreHook.FileMonitor` example.


### Windows Symbol Support

CoreHook supports symbol name lookup from PDBs to get function addresses with the use of `LocalHook.GetProcAddress`. For symbol lookup to work, you must either place the PDB file in the directory of the target program you are hooking or set the environment variable `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` to a symbol server. [You can read more about Windows symbol support from the Microsoft documentation here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dxtecharts/debugging-with-symbols#using-the-microsoft-symbol-server)

**Important:** To use the complete symbol lookup, you need to have both `dbghelp.dll` (provides the symbol lookup APIs) and `symsrv.dll` (provides the symbol server lookup) and in your [DLL search path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order). You can add these files to the directory of your target program or add them to your path. You can get both DLLs by installing the [***Debugging Tools for Windows***](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/).

Example locations where you can find `dbghelp.dll` and `symsrv.dll` are:

* **%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x86** (For 32-bit applications)
* **%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64** (For 64-bit applications)

An example of what you can set the environment variable `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` to is:

```
srv*C:\SymbolCache*https://msdl.microsoft.com/downloads/symbols
```

The `C:\SymbolCache` folder is a local cache directory where symbol files can be stored or downloaded to. When Windows needs to retrieve a PDB for a DLL, it can download them from `https://msdl.microsoft.com/downloads/symbols` and store them in a folder for use by a debugger.

You can confirm that symbol support is properly configured by running the [symbols tests](tests/CoreHook.Tests/Windows/SymbolsTest.cs).
